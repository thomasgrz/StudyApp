# StudyApp 

A visually appealing Pomodoro timer combined with an interactive Todo list.
The Pomodoro study technique consists of creating a list of Todo tasks and then
setting a timer for 25 minutes, during which time time you focus solely on the lists 
of tasks to be done, followed by a 5 minute break. You do this four times and then take 
a half hour to an hour break before repeating another four intervals. You repeat this process 
until all you tasks are completed.

The end goal of this application is for to be fully offline functional, include user profiles, track
and aggregate study tasks, data, and time. This data will ideally be compiled for you in a calendar
so you may better understand your work habits and where you are spending the most time.

Written in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python (most likely when it is launched to a server.)
